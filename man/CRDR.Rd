\description{
Calculate the correlated response to selection (CRDR) based on the fitted
model. The CRDR is calculated as described by Atlin et al. E.g. for a model
with trials nested within scenarios, which has a random part that looks like
this: genotype + genotype:scenario + genotype:scenario:trial the CRDR is
calculated as:\cr\cr
\deqn{H1 = \sigma_G^2 / (\sigma_G^2 + \sigma_S^2 / s + \sigma_{ST}^2 / st +
\sigma_E^2 / str)}
\deqn{H2 = (\sigma_G^2 + \sigma_S^2) / (\sigma_G^2 + \sigma_S^2 +
\sigma_{ST}^2 / st + \sigma_E^2 / str)}
\deqn{CRDR = (\sigma_G^2 / (\sigma_G^2 + \sigma_S^2)) * sqrt(H1 / H2)}
In these formula the \eqn{\sigma} terms stand for the standard deviations of
the respective model terms, and the lower case letters for the number of
levels for the respective model terms. So \eqn{\sigma_S} is the standard
deviation for the scenario term in the model and \eqn{s} is the number of
scenario's \eqn{\sigma_E} corresponds to the residual standard deviation and
\eqn{r} to the number of replicates.
