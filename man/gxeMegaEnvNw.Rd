\usage{
gxeMegaEnvNw(
  TD,
  trials = names(TD),
  trait,
  useWinGeno = TRUE,
  method = c("max", "min"),
  cutOff = 0.8,

}
\arguments{
\item{TD}{An object of class \code{\link{TD}}.}

\item{trials}{A character string specifying the trials to be analyzed. If
not supplied, all trials are used in the analysis.}

\item{trait}{A character string specifying the trait to be analyzed.}

\item{useWinGeno}{Should only the best genotype per trial be used for
determining mega environments? If \code{FALSE} hierarchical clustering is
applied to classify locations into mega environments that are consistent
across years.}

\item{method}{A character string indicating the criterion to determine
the best genotype per environment, either \code{"max"} or \code{"min"}.}

\item{cutOff}{A numerical value indicating the proportion of best genotypes
per location used in the calculation, i.e. a value of 0.8 indicates that
the best 80\% genotypes will be used.}

\item{byYear}{Should the analysis be done by year? If \code{TRUE} the data
is split by the variable year, analysis is performed and the results are
merged together and returned.}

\item{sumTab}{Should a summary table be printed?}
}
\value{
The input object of class \code{\link{TD}} with an added extra
column megaEnv.
}
\description{
This function fits an AMMI model and then using the fitted values produces
a new factor clustering the trials. This factor is added as a column megaEnv
to the input data. If a column megaEnv already exists this column is
overwritten with a warning.\cr\cr
Mega environments can be created by two methods. The first method
(\code{useWinGeno = TRUE}) groups
environments based on their best performing genotype; i.e. environments that
share the same best genotype belong to the same mega environment, regardless
whether environments correspond to years or locations.\cr\cr
In the second method (\code{useWinGeno = FALSE}),
genotypes that are above a certain quantile are used to classify locations
into mega environments that are consistent across years. In this method,
genotypes are scored according to a \code{cutOff} threshold for the genotypic
ranking within each location (one if a genotype is above the cutOff and zero
if below). This genotype by location matrix with ones and zeros is used to
calculate the correlation between locations. Then, correlations across years
are combined using the method by Charter and Alexander (1993). The combined
correlations are used to calculate Euclidean distances for hierarchical
clustering. The number of mega environments obtained with the hierarchical
clustering procedure is chosen to maximize the correlated response to
selection within mega environments, as proposed in Atlin et al (2000).

## Calculate mega environments for TDMaize.
gemegaEnv <- gxeMegaEnv(TD = TDMaize, trait = "yld")

## Calculate new mega environments based on the genotypes with the lowest
## value per environment.
gemegaEnv2 <- gxeMegaEnv(TD = TDMaize, trait = "yld", method = "min")
