Description: Genotype by environment (GxE) analysis of field trials. One of a
    series of statistical genetic packages for streamlining the analysis of 
    typical plant breeding experiments developed by Biometris.
    Some functions have been created to be used in conjunction with the R 
    package 'asreml' for the 'ASReml' software, which can be obtained upon 
    purchase from 'VSN' international (<http://www.vsni.co.uk/software/asreml-r>).
