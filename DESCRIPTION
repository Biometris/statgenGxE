Description: Analysis of multi environment data of plant breeding experiments
    following the analyses described in Malosetti, Ribaut, 
    and van Eeuwijk (2013), <doi:10.3389/fphys.2013.00044>.
    One of a series of statistical genetic packages for streamlining the analysis of 
    typical plant breeding experiments developed by Biometris.
    Some functions have been created to be used in conjunction with the R 
    package 'asreml' for the 'ASReml' software, which can be obtained upon 
    purchase from 'VSN' international (<https://www.vsni.co.uk/software/asreml-r>).
