Description: The R Analytical Pipeline (RAP), commissioned by the Generation 
    Challenge Program (GCP), is being developed to streamline the analysis of 
    typical plant breeding experiments, including both phenotypic analysis of 
    field trials and genotype-by-environment analysis. Some functions have
    been created to be used in conjunction with the R package 'asreml' for 
    the 'ASReml' software, which can be obtained upon purchase from 'VSN' 
    international (<http://www.vsni.co.uk/software/asreml>).
