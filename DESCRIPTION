Description: The statgen packages, developed by Biometris, have been developed 
    to streamline the analysis of typical plant breeding experiments, including
    both phenotypic analysis of field trials and genotype-by-environment 
    analysis. statgenGxE can be used for genotype by environment analysis.
    Some functions have been created to be used in conjunction with the R 
    package 'asreml' for the 'ASReml' software, which can be obtained upon 
    purchase from 'VSN' international (<http://www.vsni.co.uk/software/asreml>).
