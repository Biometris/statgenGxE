Description: The statgen packages, commissioned by the Generation Challenge 
    Program (GCP), are being developed to streamline the analysis of typical 
    plant breeding experiments, including both phenotypic analysis of field 
    trials and genotype-by-environment analysis. statgenGxE can be used for 
    genotype by environment analysis.
    Some functions have been created to be used in conjunction with the R 
    package 'asreml' for the 'ASReml' software, which can be obtained upon 
    purchase from 'VSN' international (<http://www.vsni.co.uk/software/asreml>).
